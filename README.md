# Introduction
These are some customizations I've made from <a href="https://github.com/aranasaurus/zemm-blinks.zsh-theme">aranasaurus/zemm-blinks.zsh-theme</a>

Changes

* Date format from full text to ISO format
* Removed Mercurial support (I just don't use it)
* Changed colorscheme
* removed hostname
* various styling tweaks and ascii chars

## Instructions
To use, copy the xcalibr-blinks.zsh-theme file into your $ZSH\_CUSTOM directory and set your theme to xcalibr-blinks in your .zshrc.

#### Antigen

`$ antigen theme KingEdwardI/zemm-blinks.zsh-theme xcalibr-blinks`

#### Oh My ZSH

clone this into .oh-my-zsh/themes and move the theme file out of the folder

In the oh-my-zsh rc file add the line

`ZSH-THEME="xcalibr-blinks"`
